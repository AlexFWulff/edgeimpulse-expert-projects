# Welcome

This Docs repository contains all of the Projects built by the Edge Impulse Expert Network.

There are computer vision, audio classification, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, robotics, environmental and spacial awareness and more, covering a wide variety of hardware, sensors, and devices.

As you browse the projects, be sure to make note that many of them could be adapted to use other hardware targets, sensors, or add-ons.  If you have any questions, simply let us know over on the [Forums](https://forum.edgeimpulse.com/)
